INSTRUCTIONS
------------
Put all files in one directory.

You must compile doing 
cc main.c image.c -o programa (C)

gcc  main.c image.c -o programa (C++)

This creates an executable file called programa.
Run it by
./programa
Its execution creates a file called test.gif (you can change 
this name from inside main.c). 

The color palette that it uses (blue.map) is also indicated from the inside of main.c.
The files *.map are different color palettes, which assign an RGB color (3 numbers)
to every number from 0 to 255. You can create your own palette files, but some examples are in the directory.

REMEMBER TO COMPILE USING -lm TO LINK TO THE MATH LIBRARY

cc -lm main.c image.c -o programa
